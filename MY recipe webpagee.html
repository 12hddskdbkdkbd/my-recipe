    <p align="left">Spaghetti Carbonara is one of those perfect foods that bring immediate comfort, and this homemade
      pizza will do just that. It keeps the creaminess and saltiness of the traditional pasta classic with the added
      perk
      of fluffy pizza dough and melty mozzarella. Crispy pancetta and sharp Pecorino adorn the pizza dough before
      it hits the
      oven, and once the crust begins to puff and the cheese melts, eggs adorn the top (a crucial ingredient!).
      Adding the eggs
      partway through cooking ensures the eggs don't overcook—a runny yolk is a must on this carbonara pizza
      recipe.</align>
      <h1><i>Ingredients</i></h1>
      <p align="left">1. 4 oz diced pancetta or chopped thick-cut bacon<br>
         2. 1 lb fresh pizza dough, at room temperature<br>
         3. All-purpose flour, for dusting<br>
         4. 2 cups shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese<br>
         5. 1/4 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, grated, plus more for topping<br>
         6. 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, plus more for topping<br>
         7. 1 large egg<br>
         8. 1 large egg yolk<br>
         9. 1 Tbsp chopped chives, for topping</p>
         <h1><b>Direction</b></h1>
         <p align="left">Preheat oven to 450°F with a rack in lower third position. Place pancetta in a large skillet. Cook over
            medium,
            stirring occasionally, until golden and starting to crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer pancetta
            to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.</p>
            <hr>
            <p align="left">Gently stretch dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured work surface. Transfer to a lightly floured
               baking sheet.
               Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella and Pecorino Romano, leaving a 3/4-inch border around edges. Top with
               cooked pancetta and sprinkle with pepper.</p>
               <hr>
               <p align="left">Bake until crust is puffed but still pale and cheese is melted, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, place egg and yolk
                  in a small
                  bowl or measuring cup (do not whisk).</p><hr>
               <p align="left">Carefully pull rack with pizza out from oven and tip eggs onto center of pizza. Using a fork, carefully spread
                  egg white over
                  a larger area to help eggs cook evenly. Return to oven and bake until whites are set and yolks are runny, about
                  5 minutes.</p><hr>
               <p align="left">Break yolks with a spoon and drizzle all over pizza, if desired. Top with chives, Pecorino Romano, and
                  several grinds of pepper.</p><hr>
